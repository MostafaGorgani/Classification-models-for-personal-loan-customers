# Classification-models-for-personal-loan-customers
In this project, we use data from bank loans to customers, and I have used logistic classification and random forest models to predict whether a loan will be granted to a customer or not. It was observed that the random forest model had better results than the logistic model in predicting the granting or non-granting of loans to bank customers. But when all explanatory variables of the model, including numerical and continuous variables, were converted into categorical variables, it was observed that the performance of the logistic model was slightly better than the random forest model. Here, we did not remove the zip code variable, but it was shown that this variable has a high explanatory power in predicting the dependent variable.
