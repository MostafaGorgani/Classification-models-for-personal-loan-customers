The data set includes 5000 observations with fourteen variables divided into four different measurement categories.
The binary category has five variables, including the target variable personal loan, also securities account, CD account, 
online banking and credit card. The interval category contains five variables: age, experience, income, CC avg and mortgage. 
The ordinal category includes the variables family and education. The last category is nominal with ID and Zip code. 
The variable ID does not add any interesting information e.g. individual association between a person (indicated by ID) and 
loan does not provide any general conclusion for future potential loan customers. Therefore, it will be neglected in the examination.
